The more I get to know you
Can't tell the feelings I feel
Sometimes it doesn't feel so right
몇 번을 노력해도
맘처럼 안 돼 계속
I think I'm losing my whole mind
It must be
One of us, one of us making
Two of us, two of us feel the
Same unusual feeling
말하기엔 좀 복잡해
네 생각이 더 궁금해 넌 어때
Do you feel just like I do
So Why you looking at me like I'm your
Boyfriend, boyfriend
Why you looking at me like I'm your
Boyfriend, boyfriend
Why you looking at me like I'm your
Boyfriend, boyfriend
Why you looking at me like I'm
Why you looking at me like I'm your boyfriend
Will you stay here til the sunrise
매일 밤 곁을 지킬게
나도 모른 채 우린 가까워져 가
What should I do
It must be
One of us, one of us making
Two of us, two of us feel the
Same unusual feeling
말하기엔 좀 복잡해
네 생각이 더 궁금해 넌 어때
Do you feel just like I do
So Why you looking at me like I'm your
Boyfriend, boyfriend
Why you looking at me like I'm your
Boyfriend, boyfriend
Why you looking at me like I'm your
Boyfriend, boyfriend
Why you looking at me like I'm
Why you looking at me like I'm your boyfriend
Call me back when you are sober
I'm afraid I might ever lose ya
Running through my head,
got a thousand thoughts
Why you looking at me like I'm your
Boyfriend, boyfriend
Why you looking at me like I'm
Why you looking at me like I'm your boyfriend
We might be something more than
Just friends, I'll be honest
I can't make a life without you
Be there for you, treat you right
I ain't like the other guys
What you like, know it like I know you
Why you looking at me like I'm your
Boyfriend, boyfriend
Why you looking at me like I'm your
Boyfriend, boyfriend
Why you looking at me like I'm your
Boyfriend, boyfriend
Why you looking at me like I'm
Why you looking at me like I'm your boyfriend
Call me back when you are sober
I'm afraid I might ever lose ya
Running through my head,
got a thousand thoughts
Why you looking at me like I'm your
Boyfriend, boyfriend
Why you looking at me like I'm
Why you looking at me like I'm your boyfriend
